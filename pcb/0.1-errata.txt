 - 27211A not pin compatible with IR2183:
   Rotate chip 180 degrees
   Move high side FET source connection from pin 6 to 8
   Low side input is not inverted
   Bootstrap-diode built in
 - Switch uC to PIC18LF26K22 or better
 - Add 0.1u ceramic caps close to switch (especially on input)
 - Room for more bulk capacitance and through hole caps
 - PTC fuses in input and battery
 - Ideal diode from inductor output to battery? Probably not necessary with PTC fuse
